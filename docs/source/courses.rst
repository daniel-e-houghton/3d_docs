3D Computer Animation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3D computer animation has revolutionized animation, graphics, and special effects. In this course students will explore basic 3D modeling techniques, virtual material and texture creation, digital lighting, rendering, and animation. Every workshop will be hands on and fully immersed in this rapidly evolving technology. Students will leave with a strong conceptual understanding of the 3D graphics pipeline, a fundamental 3D skill set, options for further study, and an independent final animation project.

3D Environment Design
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the grounds of an ancient ruin to the inside of a biological cell to the stage of a theatrical production to the corridors of the international space station, in this course we will use digital 3d modeling, texturing, and lighting tools to visualize locations into beautifully rendered, three dimensional, interactive virtual environments. We will ask critical questions about how every design choice affects the audienceâ€™s understanding of the space. No prior experience is necessary for this hands-on introductory course.
